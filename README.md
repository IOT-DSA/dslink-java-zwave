# dslink-java-zwave
Mostly functional with the following features still under development:
- The "refresh" feature for the ZWave controller crashes sometimes.
 As a result, the application may need to be restarted after using "refresh"
- The SCHEDULE, BUTTON data types are not implemented.
- Have not implemented detection of non-setable points.  Currently, all points are
 assumed setable, even if they actually are not.
